# Go

Go packages that don't really deserve their own repos.

Inspired by [tj/go](https://github.com/tj/go).

## Packages

- [ds](ds): Data structures, including useful items like a generic Queue and ConcurrentQueue wrapper
- [worker](worker): Common worker implementations, such as an IntervalWorker that processes a ConcurrentQueue.
